    <p>When it comes to photography, colour has the power to both take a good image to great, or take that same image, and absolutely ruin it!</p>

    <p>We think and feel in colour, which makes it obvious that well utilised colour draws the eye of the viewer. Here are some examples of the different types!</p>
  
    <h3>"Dominant colour"</h3>
    <p>A dominant colour is one that is stronger than the other. For example, a bright orange would stand out against a background of grey concrete. You can use dominant colours to your advantage, making certain things pop-out from the rest of the image. But be careful! Choosing too many dominant colours can be confusing to the eye!</p>

    <p>This photograph by the American photographer William Eggleston is mostly blue, so you would say that blue is the dominant colour (it stands out, above all the rest).</p>
   
    <h3>Complimentary colours</h3>
    <p>Choosing colours that sit directly opposite each other on the colour wheel is one way of showing contrast and emphasis in your photos. Complementary colours are those that work well togethers. For example, blue and orange goes well together!</p>
